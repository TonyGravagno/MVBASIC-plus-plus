# Notepad-plus-plus-D3
This is my attempt at creating the neccessary files for notepad++.
So far I have gone through the steps of "Define your Language" in notepad++.
This file name is D3Language, I have chosen color schemes that somewhat mirror python, as our community will be seeing that in the future.
I have also started an xml file for all the keywords used in the D3 language in both UPPER and lower case.
My goal is to get the functions of D3 built into the xml file.
